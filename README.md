# Staff Evaluation System

### This project was made during the "Database Systems" course at CEID, University of Patras
---
We made an interface that helps speed up the evaluation process of a company's staff. This includes many actions of the managers, the admin and the regural employees. It was developed in Java using the NetBeans IDE, which offers a user-friendly environment to develop GUI in Java. MariaDB was used for the database.
